      "<p>The <strong>Li-Ning TecTonic 9 3U Badminton Racket</strong> is suited towards doubles and singles players favouring attacking power play from the rear of the court.</p><p>The TecTonic 9 is produced from a special lightweight T1100G military-grade carbon fibre that delivers incredible recovery times and strength. This high-modulus carbon fibre offers substantial performance improvements over other carbon fibres and can be found in aircraft structures, rocket launchers and more.</p><p>Experience the power to break through new limits with a unique flexible frame structure at 5' and 7 o'clock positions to absorb potential rebound energy, doubling the acceleration power of the racket in return. With the 'Thunderbolt Cloud' Technology and T1100G High Modulus carbon-fibre frame, the racket's overall stability is improved by suppressing turbulence and improving striking precision. The Energy Absorption Rebound Technology also enhances the racket's rebound speed and increases shuttlecock acceleration by 3.2% (Li-Ning lab data).</p><p>This racket falls under the Combat series and so features a heavier head and a higher balance point. Suitable for very strong, aggressive players looking for maximum power..</p><p>Featuring:</p><p><strong>TB-Nano</strong> - Designed for improved power transfer, nanometer technology binds carbon-fiber and resin more tightly, allowing grater stability, elasticity and durability.</p><p><strong>Wing Stabiliser </strong>- Aviation technology that stabilises frame vibration to improve comfort, control and racket recovery.</p><p><strong>Hot Melt</strong> - The resin distributed more uniformly and closely combined with the carbon fibre by using the Hot Melt. It improves the strength and provides the same excellent using experience.</p><p><strong>Cubic Locking</strong> - Cubic grommet locked within the slim groove is more stable and could provide extra protection for string, effectively absorb shock to get an accurate placement, improve controlling performance.</p><p><strong>Stabilised Torsion Angle</strong> - STA improves the torsion resistance performance of the racket, stabilising the frame quickly even when hitting away from the sweet-point. This helps to create high-quality strikes, making your attack more effective.</p><p>BadmintonHQ is an authorised Li-Ning stockist and all Li-Ning products sold by us are 100% genuine</p><p>*Please note that all Li-Ning rackets require a custom restring as they are not strung by the manufacturer.</p><p><br></p>",

      "<p>The Victor Thruster Onigiri Badminton Racket is an advanced level power racket, suited to experienced players looking to dictate games with powerful hitting from the rear court. The medium flex shaft requires less effort to transfer power to the shuttle, allowing a more relaxed swing style.</p>  <p>Featuring:</p>  <p>Core Shell Rubber (C.S.R) - Core shell rubber is used to cover the epoxy resins to build resilience and protection. Core shell rubber is added into carbon fiber and the foam materials used to fill the frame, which not only increases the extension strength of carbon fiber, but also improves the resilience. The Foamex turns much more compacted during the foaming process and possesses with better shock absorption once the foaming is done.</p>  <p>GTX - Through the combination of various angles of carbon fiber and frame type, the racket performance is 8% higher.</p>  <p>Flash Shaft - Made by the combinations of various carbon fibers and reduce the shaft diameter to give the racket a quick resilience ability.</p>  <p>Power Box - The box-shaped design effectively increases the stability and anti-torque, can stand higher string tension.</p>  <p>Continuation Grommet - Takes up the wind and increase the swing speed and prevent the frame from damaging by the strings while in high stringing tension.</p>  <p>Internal T-Joint - One-piece T-Joint (compare to the external T-joint), transfer the power smoothly, and precise the hit.</p>  <p>Seven-Six76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life.</p>",

The Tour version is designed to replicate the capabilities of the Pro but at an easier price point and tailored to suit the experienced club player.</p> <p>The Arcsaber 7 Tour is designed for the all-round player, looking to combine power, speed and control. The medium flex frame is forgiving and allows power generation on less explosive swings with a softer, whippier feel. This 4U/G5 version will likely suit experienced doubles players wanting a frame that will benefit them evenly in all parts of the court, in an all-round game style, with plenty of control.</p>  <p>Yonex have streamlined this latest edition, introducing a slimmer shaft for greater speed and a completely new frame design. The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact and continues on the forgiving comfortable feel that is synonymous with the Arcsaber range. Yonex have engineered this racket around the concept of 'hold for flight', meaning increased shuttle hold on the strings at impact, for greater control and feel.</p>  <p>Featuring:</p>  <p>ISOMETRIC Enlarged Sweet Spot - The ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7% compared to a conventional round frame. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.</p>  <p>Super Slim Shaft - The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p>  <p>Energy Boost CAP Plus - Uniquely shaped cap which maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the sides arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting. This allows for greater control without losing the flex required for power generation.</p>  <p>T-ANCHOR - A new composite material T-ANCHOR used in the T-joint helps reduce excess torque when hitting an off centre shot, making the racket more forgiving and easier to use.</p>  <p>Rexis Shaft - A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex moulding technique. Improves shot performance and dominates the game.</p>  <p>Box Frame - The extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.</p>  <p>POCKETING BOOSTER - The frame is lined with POCKETING BOOSTER, a proprietary rubber-like material emphasizing elasticity in the frame’s flex.</p>  <p>Enhanced Arcsaber Frame - Control with confidence through this unique frame structure with varying levels of flex from top, sides, to bottom, built to increase shuttle hold while reducing instability and twisting at impact.</p>",

This racket was manufactured to enhance smashing power to dominate your opponents on the court, whilst its stability weight distribution technology keeps shots controlled and precise while boosting your power. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) of this racket makes it much more user-friendly and responsive, whilst still packing a powerful punch and being incredibly well-rounded. </p><p>Several technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court. For players who like splitting their opponent's defense open from the back of the court, this 88D Tour is a must-have. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO+ Box Frame</strong>: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. </p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong>: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%.

The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.</p><p><strong>Stability Weight Distribution</strong>:<strong> </strong>The added weight distribution on the sides of the frame enhances stability during the swing, resulting in maximized smash power and allowing for the effective breakdown of defenses during back-court attacks.</p><p><strong>REXIS Shaft</strong>: A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex molding technique. Improves shot performance and dominates the game.</p><p><strong>Ultra Slim Shaft</strong>: Inserting NANOPREME into the racket shaft ensures greater stability compared to conventional rackets. When bending and releasing two racquets under the same force, the Ultra Slim Long Shaft rebounds almost twice as far as a conventional racquet does in the same length of time (0.018 seconds). This equates to 10% greater stability compared with conventional racquets.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong>: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>Power Assister Bumper</strong>: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.</p><p><br></p>",

    description:
      "<p>The Yonex Astrox 88S Tour is the little brother of the 88S Pro racket, slightly toned down to make it more user-friendly whilst still suitable for advanced players. Sporting a brand-new black and silver colourway and game-changing technology the 88S Tour is a fantastic racket for aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output. </p><p>The 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) provides extra maneuverability, with the lower weight combining with the super slim shaft to minimise air resistance. The super slim shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. </p><p>Numerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO+ Box Frame</strong>: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. </p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong>: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>Rotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force</strong>: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.</p><p><strong>Expanded Sweet Spot</strong>: The tailored 67cm racket length enables fast maneuverability, while the expansion of the sweet spot area by optimizing the frame design increases precision. Supports fast rallies and secures points from front-court attacks.</p><p><strong>REXIS Shaft</strong>: A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex molding technique. Improves shot performance and dominates the game.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft</strong>: The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong>: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>Power Assister Bumper</strong>: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.</p><p> </p>",

    description:
      "<p>The third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88D Pro is here, sporting a brand-new black and silver colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at defensive players looking to maximise their control and power output, the 88D Pro is a state-of-the-art racket built for powerful players.</p>\n<p>The 88D excels in backcourt play, being a robust and stable racket designed with power in mind. This racket was manufactured to enhance smashing power to dominate your opponents on the court, whilst its stability weight distribution technology keeps shots controlled and precise while boosting your power. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) of this racket makes it much more user-friendly and responsive, whilst still packing a powerful punch and being incredibly well-rounded.</p>\n<p>Several technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court. For players who like splitting their opponent's defense open from the back of the court, few can compete with the 88D Pro. </p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>AERO+ Box Frame</strong>: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. </p>\n<p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong>: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force</strong>: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.</p>\n<p><strong>Stability Weight Distribution</strong>:<strong> </strong>The added weight distribution on the sides of the frame enhances stability during the swing, resulting in maximized smash power and allowing for the effective breakdown of defenses during back-court attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber</strong>: The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p>\n<p><strong>Ultra Slim Shaft</strong>: Inserting NANOPREME into the racket shaft ensures greater stability compared to conventional rackets. When bending and releasing two racquets under the same force, the Ultra Slim Long Shaft rebounds almost twice as far as a conventional racquet does in the same length of time (0.018 seconds). This equates to 10% greater stability compared with conventional racquets.</p>\n<p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong>: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p>\n<p><strong>Power Assister Bumper</strong>: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.</p>\n<p><br></p>",

    description:
      "<p>The Victor Auraspeed HS B badminton racket is an advanced level doubles racket for experienced players who are looking for greater speed and precision.</p>   <p>The Auraspeed HS (Hypersonic) has made the classic DYNAMIC-SWORD even lighter and thinner to lower the wind resistance and enable faster hits and returns. Engineered with the innovative new material Nano Fortify SR, the frame of ARS-HS is thin, light, stiff, durable, and fatigue-resistant. The speed and elasticity of the racket has been significantly improved, making ARS-HS a racket that can provide you with both outstanding stiffness and incredible handling experience.</p>  <p>The shaft is built with the cutting-edge composite carbon fiber material PYROFIL to make the racket stiff and lightweight. With a diameter of 6.8 mm, the shaft allows for more improvement in speed and enables smooth force transmission and greater controllability.</p>  <p>Unlike traditional solid wooden handles, the FREE CORE synthetic handle made with nanotechnology has an innovative hollow structure to improve shock-absorption and create more space for the shaft to flex. It not only allows for smoother hitting and better rebound, but also makes the transition from defense to attack hard for the opponent to be prepared for. The transparent cap exclusively designed by VICTOR further provides a peek into the secret of FREE CORE technology.</p>  <p>Featuring:</p> <p>SEVEN SIX 76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life. </p> <p>PYROFIL - Pyrofil carbon fibre and it's composites, are advanced high performance materials from Japan. The characteristic of high intensity, ultra-light bonds offers excelent racket shock absorption and enhances control.</p> <p>HARD CORED TECHNOLOGY - Inspired by military helicopters, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimises material sizes and reinforces handling performance.</p> <p>FREE CORE - Designed by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionised handle style allows the shaft to move more freely. Swings are not only smoother but the overall feel and handling experience is improved.  </p><p>COMPOUND SWORD - The compound frame design can be divided into three major parts: The upper section is made with fan shaped structure to lower wind resistance and accelerate each swing. The Compund-Sword structure in the middle section is designed to lighten the filler and enable fast rebound. Finally, the lower section is built in airfoil structure to lower wind resistance and keep excellent anti-torsion performance in a 'whipping' style which helps to create steeper and quicker attacks with satisfying control.</p> <p>NANO FORTIFY - The adoption of the single-wall carbon nanotube effectively enhances racket intensity, elasticity and fatigue resistance. The lightweight enhanced material enables both strength and smooth handling.</p>",

      "<p>The Li-Ning Aeronaut 6000 Combat (3U) badminton racket is an attacking racket suited to intermediate to advanced singles or doubles players looking for a racket to play an all-round game style with a good balance of power, control and speed.</p>\n<p>All Li-Ning Aeronaut series rackets have a unique air-stream channel integrated into the racket head. This reduces air resistance which helps to generate faster racket head speeds. Li-Ning rackets in the COMBAT series are ideal for strong, aggressive players who want to use maximum power in shots for stronger smashes with great control over the racket.</p>\n<p>The AERONAUT technology platform uses a 4-digit numbering system. The first digit determines the grade of the racket as follows:</p>\n<p>If the first digit is 1, 2 or 3, the racket is suitable for beginners.</p>\n<p>If the first digit is 4, 5 or 6, the racket is suitable for intermediate players.</p>\n<p>If the first digit is 7, 8 or 9, the racket is suitable for advanced/professional players.</p>\n<p><strong>Featuring:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>TB-Nano</strong> - Designed for improved power transfer, nanometer technology binds carbon-fiber and resin more tightly, allowing grater stability, elasticity and durability.</p>\n<p><strong>Hot Melt</strong> - The resin distributed more uniformly and closely combined with the carbon fibre by using the Hot Melt. It improves the strength and provides the same excellent using experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Stabilised Torsion Angle</strong> - STA improves the torsion resistance performance of the racket, stabilising the frame quickly even when hitting away from the sweet-point. This helps to create high-quality strikes, making your attack more effective.</p>\n<p><strong>Aero Tec-Beam System</strong> - Based on aerodynamics, support of advanced calculation and gathering practising data, the racket frame has an extremely low drag coefficient and high intensity to provide maximum speed and improve players' performance in various shots.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic-Optimum Frame</strong> - This unique head-design, enlarges the sweet-spot of the racket. It allows for more consistent and higher hitting velocity, without sacrificing durability.</p>\n<p>BadmintonHQ is an authorised Li-Ning stockist and all Li-Ning products sold by us are 100% genuine</p>\n<p>*Please note that all Li-Ning rackets require a custom restring as they are not strung by the manufacturer.</p>\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>",

Extreme racket recoil velocity gives excellent manoeuvrability for ultimate speed and control.</p><p><strong>Vectran Enhanced </strong>- Super elastic Vectran fibres are five times stronger than steel. Braided Vectran and Carbon fibres in the shaft increase elastic responsiveness, dramatically increasing power return for greater penetrative shot-making.</p><p><strong>Torsional Control System</strong> - By flattening the T-joint section, torsional twist is minimised on shuttle impact providing a stable platform and improving shot accuracy and control.</p><p><strong>Bi-Axial Dynamics</strong> - Carlton’s Bi-Axial Dynamic frame develops more efficient aerodynamics in both directions compared to competitor frames. This increased efficiency is delivered through a cross-sectional frame profile that is more aerodynamic than competitors' frames. During development, over 80% of players stated the new Bi-Axial frame profile delivered increased swing speed.</p><p><strong>High-Repulsion Shaft</strong> - High-Repulsion Shaft is engineered with the highest precision in shaft manufacturing ensuring 360-degree balanced graphite layups. Higher power and increased precision are achieved by blending the optimum flexibility and kick point of your Carlton racket shaft every time you swing it.</p><p><strong>XTREME Tension Frame</strong> - Precision engineering and the utilisation of the finest construction materials ensure your Carlton frame can accommodate 11% higher string tensions compared with competitor frames.</p><p><strong>PRO V12 Grommets</strong> - Positioned at 3 and 9 o’clock these specialised grommets have been softened to allow greater string movement thereby increasing power across the hitting zone.</p><p><strong>Stabilisor Top Cap</strong> - By introducing 4 convex channels into the top cap, the stiffness of the top cap is increased allowing for greater shot accuracy and control.</p>",

      "<p><strong>They'll never see it coming.</strong></p><p>The new <strong>Yonex Nanoflare 800 Tour Badminton Racket</strong> is based on the Yonex Nanoflare 800 Pro Racket, toned down to suit the needs of advanced players who want to use rackets similar to the pros.</p><p>The Nanoflare 800 is perfectly suited for fast games where quick reflexes are required, making it ideal for high-level doubles play, for players who love being the aggressor close to the net. With a head-light balance, this racket can be whipped around with ease, so nothing can hold you back when defending smashing, or in flat rallies.</p><p>The Super Slim Shaft used on this racket is Yonex's thinnest yet, vastly reducing air resistance and providing added feel. Combine this with the Sonic Flare system, which is strategically lined high-modulus graphite at the top and bottom of the frame, and you have a racket proven to produce high initial speeds upon hitting a shuttle.</p><p>The frame itself is dedicated to drives, with a steep angle from the stringing area to the T-joint and copper used at the bottom of the frame, increasing the rigidity of the racket and further enhancing repulsion, enabling powerful drives to take your opponent by surprise. The wide profile of the frame is also key, providing extra racket surface stability to minimise warping during your swing and produce powerful, controlled shots.</p><p><strong>Features</strong>:</p><p><strong>Nanocell NEO:</strong> A resilient yet surprisingly flexible graphite material.</p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC:</strong> Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>Sonic Flare System:</strong> The revolutionary new graphite material TORAYCAR M40X and SUPER HMG provide unrivaled power and stability for maximum shuttle acceleration.</p><p><strong>Super HMG:</strong> Super High Modulus Graphite, used to increase durability and stability.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft:</strong> The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS:</strong> A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>Built In T-Joint:</strong> Increases strength between the frame and shaft eliminating head twist for more control.</p><p> </p>",

      "<p>The Victor Thruster Ryuga II 3U badminton racket is a lethal option for offensive players and is the weapon of choice for one of the most powerful and explosive players on the pro tour, Lee Zii Jia (Malaysia). The Ryuga II is suited to strong players looking to do most of their damage from the rear of the court with the medium-stiff flex and head heavy balance helping to transfer power into drives and smashes.</p> <p>This 2nd generation Ryuga is a personal favourite of the BadmintonHQ staff, not only for its powerful characteristics, but also for the beautiful purple and black colourway.</p> The Thruster Ryuga II features Victor's latest technology including the innovative Free Core handle for smoother swings, greater handling and improved comfort.  <p>Featuring</p> <p>Power Box - The box shaped design effectively increases the stability and anti-torque, can stand stand higher string tension.</p> <p>WES 2.0 - The innovative carbon fiber layering design has improved the anti-torsion performance, further making the racket flex faster with better force transmission. As a redefinition of 'whipping effect', the WES 2.0 allows the players to drive the shuttle at a sharp downward angle when attacking.</p> <p>SEVEN SIX 76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life. </p> <p>PYROFIL - Pyrofil carbon fibre and it's composites, are advanced high performance materials from Japan. The characteristic of high intensity, ultra-light bonds offers excelent racket shock absorption and enhances control.</p> <p>HARD CORED TECHNOLOGY - Inspired by military helicopters, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimises material sizes and reinforces handling performance.</p> <p>FREE CORE - Designed by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionised handle style allows the shaft to move more freely. Swings are not only smoother but the overall feel and handling experience is improved.</p>",

      '<p>The latest, enhanced edition of the extremely popular Thruster F is an advanced level racket suited to hard hitting doubles players. This edition is a 4U weight and is used by 4 x World Champion doubles player Hendra Setiawan. You may also want to check out our full range of <a href="https://badmintonhq.co.uk/collections/victor-badminton-rackets" title="Victor Badminton Rackets">Victor Badminton Rackets</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>TK-F Enhanced Edition embodies the essence of the efforts made by the Victor R&amp;D team for the past two years. Both of its balance point and swing weight are lighter than the first generation of TK-F, thus further delivering a more comfortable hitting experience. What’s more, the elastic racket frame and stronger shaft make the change of direction smoother, which helps achieve accurate and powerful smashes and incredible controllability. Fully upgraded inside and out, TK-F Enhanced Edition is going to help you make more aggressive attacks.</p>\n<p>Victor has also introduced it\'s <strong>Free Core</strong> injection moulded handle for smoother swings, improved handling and greater feel.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0020/9407/1890/files/74211_2_20210828005916_d0a1b2a6-f579-4cef-bc69-ebc7d00b6915_480x480.jpg?v=1660923196" width="306" height="204" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0020/9407/1890/files/74211_2_20210828005916_d0a1b2a6-f579-4cef-bc69-ebc7d00b6915_480x480.jpg?v=1660923196"></p>\n<p>The combination of <strong>integrated square-head frame</strong> and<strong> anti- torsion slim shaft</strong> provides a larger sweet spot. The smart weight distribution and resilient shaft make it easier to serve and control the shuttlecock, achieving more powerful and effective attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>Pyrofil Carbon Fibre</strong> aids playable time till fatigue, in addition to better control and racket durability for all styles of play. Originating from the car industry, the Japanese Pyrofil ultra-light carbon fibre material and its composites, enhances handling, control and shock absorption through high-intensity, ultra-light bonds. The additional benefit is a core strength, resulting in a reliable racket construction you can trust for years to come.</p>\n<p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0020/9407/1890/files/74211_1_20210828005916_480x480.jpg?v=1660923204" width="276" height="184" data-mce-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0020/9407/1890/files/74211_1_20210828005916_480x480.jpg?v=1660923204"></p>\n<p>Allowing players to reach their maximal swing speeds and hit shots with greater power, the <strong>Tri formation system</strong> incorporates Sword, Aerodynamic and Power Box shapes in specific regions of the racket head. Hitting is optimised through the ‘Tri Formations’ integrated technology of reduced air resistance (Sword shape), efficient aerodynamics for acceleration to maximum swing speeds (Aerodynamic shape) and the ability to hit with more power as the racket is stabilised in an anti-toque design capable of withstanding higher string tensions (PowerBox shape).</p>\n<p><strong>Anti torsion system</strong> technologies enables players to hit at maximum muscle power, through reduced power loss as energy generated by you is efficiently passed to the shuttle. Acting through a small angle twist in the ferrel, the smaller angle of torsion (twisting) in the shaft material helps the handle not twist, providing optimal power transmission and anti torsion performance as power is not lost but efficiently passed on.</p>\n<p><strong>Hard Cored Technology</strong> provides players with optimal racket handling helping to increase your shot responsiveness. Inspired by helicopter rotor blade technology, a structure of multilayer carbon fibre and its composites, retains racket stiffness but minimises material size, reinforcing racket handling and performance.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note that Victor does not include a racket cover with this racket and the end caps may differ from the Far East version.</strong></p>',

Most traditional rackets feature a hollow core within the racket shaft, however the Hyper Slim Shaft on the ZZ features a solid core graphite construction, providing extra resilience and greater power transfer.</p> <p>The ever popular ISOMETRIC frame has also been tweaked to create an <strong>EXPANDED SWEET SPOT</strong> - 2.9% larger than previous models.</p> <p>With attention paid to every detail, Yonex has even redsigned the cap at the top of the handle to reduce shaft twisting and increase flexibility. For those who like to place their thumb at the top of the grip whilst serving, the indent in the <strong>ENERGY BOOST CAP</strong> also provides a comfortable and stable place for the thumb to sit.</p> <p>By utilizing high quality <strong>Namd graphite</strong> throughout the shaft and frame, more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.</p> <p><strong>The weapon of choice for former World and European Singles Champion, Viktor Axelson.</strong></p> <p><strong>*Please be aware that Yonex no longer supply a cover for this racket due to an innitiative to reduce waste and landfill. </strong></p>",

This produces an X-Treme Tension Frame with low torque and virtually no lateral movement on impact, even with miss hits.The X-Treme Tension Frame makes the Ashaway Viper rackets capable of taking higher string tensions than the market standard, higher string tensions give greater control and less string movement, this further increases shot accuracy.The Ashaway Viper XT1600 has a stiff shaft for increased power for players with an attacking mind set. Also added on the Ashaway Viper XT1600 is a Two Piece Tubular Shaft to increase torsional strength to produce this Ultra Power, X-Treme Tension Frame.</p> <p>The Viper XT1600 is the most powerful racket in the Viper Range. With its stiff flex and weighing 86g this frame is designed for players that are looking for that extra power whether it be from the rear or the mid court. The X-Treme tension frame technology that is used in the Viper range makes this racket able to take higher string tensions than market standard, which also gives extra control and less string movement when hitting those power smashes.</p> <p>*Please be aware that factory string colour may vary</p>",

      "<p>The Yonex Arcsaber 7 Pro badminton racket is an exciting update of the original Arcsaber 7, which was released back in 2007 and was a favourite with many players worldwide.</p> <p>The Arcsaber 7 Pro is made in Japan, guaranteeing quality and is designed for the all-round player, looking to combine power speed and control. The medium flex frame is forgiving and allows power generation on less explosive swings with a softer, whippier feel. This 4U/G5 version will likely suit experienced doubles players wanting a frame that will benefit them evenly in all parts of the court, in an all-round game style.</p> <p>Yonex have streamlined this latest edition, introducing a slimmer shaft for greater speed and a completely new frame design. The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact and continues on the forgiving comfortable feel that is synonymous with the Arcsaber range. Yonex have engineered this racket around the concept of 'hold for flight', meaning increased shuttle hold on the strings at impact, for greater control and feel.</p> <p>Featuring:</p> <p><strong>ISOMETRIC Enlarged Sweet Spot</strong> - The ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7% compared to a conventional round frame. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.</p> <p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber</strong> - The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fibre – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. These characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p> <p><strong>Super Slim Shaft</strong> - The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p> <p><strong>Energy Boost CAP</strong> -The new cap shape allows the shaft to flex, which ensures the maximum effect of “Namd (more flex and faster kick-back graphite material)” and stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft twisting, increasing control.</p> <p><strong>T-ANCHOR</strong> - A new composite material T-ANCHOR used in the T-joint helps reduce excess torque when hitting an off centre shot, making the racket more forgiving and easier to use.</p> <p><strong>Box Frame</strong> - The extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.</p> <p><strong>POCKETING BOOSTER</strong> - The frame is lined with POCKETING BOOSTER, a proprietary rubber-like material emphasizing elasticity in the frame’s flex.</p> <p><strong>Enhanced Arcsaber Frame</strong> - Control with confidence through this unique frame structure with varying levels of flex from top, sides, to bottom, built to increase shuttle hold while reducing instability and twisting at impact.</p>",

This is combined with a new stringing pattern, borrowed from the Astrox 88S, that looks to offer more control and longer shuttle hold.</p> <p>Please note this racket does not include a racket cover.

This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and stores energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.</p> <p><strong>AERO+BOX Frame</strong> - Combines solid hitting feel and quick swing.</p> <p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong> - ISOMETRIC technology continues to help the world’s greatest players achieve global success. Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.</p> <p><strong>Rotational Generator System</strong> - Counterbalanced Weight Distribution. By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is distributed throughout the grip end, frame top and the joint for maximum control. The transition to the next shot can be performed smoothly, with rapid succession.</p> <p><strong>Super Slim Shaft</strong> - Reduced Air Resistance. The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p> <p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong> - Uniquely shaped cap which maximizes shaft performance.The front allows the shaft to flex, while the sides arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p> <p><strong>*Please be aware that Yonex no longer supply a cover for this racket due to an innitiative to reduce waste and landfill. </strong></p>",

The head light balance also helps players to manouevre the racket quickly, for easy swinging. The E13 also features some of Yonex's signature technologies including:</p>\n<p>Isometric Head Shape - Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racket generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p>\n<p>Control Support CAP - The control support cap provides an 88% wider flat surface compared with an ordinary racquet for easier gripping, fast follow-through and the sharpest manoeuvrability.</p>\n<p>Slim Shaft - A slimmer shaft for less air drag and increased swing speed.</p>",

      "<p><strong>They'll never see it coming.</strong></p><p>The new <strong>Yonex Nanoflare 800 Pro Badminton Racket</strong> is the weapon of choice for world champions Ratchanok Intanon and Soh Wooi Yik and comes packed with technology for quick, aggressive play combined with solid power and is manufactured from high-modulus graphite for incredible stability and durability.</p><p>The Nanoflare 800 is perfectly suited for fast games where quick reflexes are required, making it ideal for high-level doubles play, for players who love being the aggressor close to the net. With a head-light balance, this racket can be whipped around with ease, so nothing can hold you back when defending smashing, or in flat rallies.</p><p>This racket sports an extra cross string, increasing string density to boost surface pressure and create enhanced repulsion for accelerated drives. Combine this with the Sonic Flare system, which is strategically lined high-modulus graphite at the top and bottom of the frame, and you have a racket proven to produce high initial speeds upon hitting a shuttle.</p><p>The frame itself is dedicated to drives, with a steep angle from the stringing area to the T-joint and copper used at the bottom of the frame, increasing the rigidity of the racket and further enhancing repulsion, enabling powerful drives to take your opponent by surprise. The wide profile of the frame is also key, providing extra racket surface stability to minimise warping during your swing and produce powerful, controlled shots.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO Frame:</strong> Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed.</p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC:</strong> Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>M40X:</strong> A next-generation, highly strong yet elastic carbon fiber.</p><p><strong>Sonic Flare System:</strong> The revolutionary new graphite material TORAYCAR M40X and SUPER HMG provide unrivaled power and stability for maximum shuttle acceleration.</p><p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber:</strong> The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft:</strong> The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS:</strong> A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>New Built In T-Joint:</strong> The lightweight T-Joint increases stability of the shuttle on the strings, maximizing power and control.</p><p> </p>",

      "<p>The <strong>Carlton Vapour Trail 87S Badminton Racket </strong>is a head-light racket, sporting a multitude of technologies to make this an ideal choice for intermediate or advanced players wanting a racket boasting high manoeuvrability, control and precision. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>Japanese High Modulus Graphite </strong> - Japanese Hi Modulus Graphite is the highest specification carbon available on the market treated with high pressurized heat for better graphite fusion ensuring your Carlton frame will outperform all other construction materials for frame response and stability.</p><p><strong>Nanocell Enhanced </strong>- Unique resin system increases overall stiffness for enhanced shot precision. Extreme racket recoil velocity gives excellent manoeuvrability for ultimate speed and control.</p><p><strong>Vectran Enhanced </strong>- Super elastic Vectran fibres are five times stronger than steel. Braided Vectran and Carbon fibres in the shaft increase elastic responsiveness, dramatically increasing power return for greater penetrative shot-making.</p><p><strong>Torsional Control System</strong> - By flattening the T-joint section, torsional twist is minimised on shuttle impact providing a stable platform and improving shot accuracy and control.</p><p><strong>Bi-Axial Dynamics</strong> - Carlton’s Bi-Axial Dynamic frame develops more efficient aerodynamics in both directions compared to competitor frames. This increased efficiency is delivered through a cross-sectional frame profile that is more aerodynamic than competitors' frames. During development, over 80% of players stated the new Bi-Axial frame profile delivered increased swing speed.</p><p><strong>High-Repulsion Shaft</strong> - High-Repulsion Shaft is engineered with the highest precision in shaft manufacturing ensuring 360-degree balanced graphite layups. Higher power and increased precision are achieved by blending the optimum flexibility and kick point of your Carlton racket shaft every time you swing it.</p><p><strong>XTREME Tension Frame</strong> - Precision engineering and the utilisation of the finest construction materials ensure your Carlton frame can accommodate 11% higher string tensions compared with competitor frames.</p><p><strong>PRO V12 Grommets</strong> - Positioned at 3 and 9 o’clock these specialised grommets have been softened to allow greater string movement thereby increasing power across the hitting zone.</p><p><strong>Stabilisor Top Cap</strong> - By introducing 4 convex channels into the top cap, the stiffness of the top cap is increased allowing for greater shot accuracy and control.</p>",

    description:
      "<p><strong>They'll never see it coming.</strong></p><p>The new <strong>Yonex Nanoflare 800 Pro Badminton Racket</strong> is the weapon of choice for world champions Ratchanok Intanon and Soh Wooi Yik and comes packed with technology for quick, aggressive play combined with solid power and is manufactured from high-modulus graphite for incredible stability and durability.</p><p>The Nanoflare 800 is perfectly suited for fast games where quick reflexes are required, making it ideal for high-level doubles play, for players who love being the aggressor close to the net. With a head-light balance, this racket can be whipped around with ease, so nothing can hold you back when defending smashing, or in flat rallies.</p><p>This racket sports an extra cross string, increasing string density to boost surface pressure and create enhanced repulsion for accelerated drives. Combine this with the Sonic Flare system, which is strategically lined high-modulus graphite at the top and bottom of the frame, and you have a racket proven to produce high initial speeds upon hitting a shuttle.</p><p>The frame itself is dedicated to drives, with a steep angle from the stringing area to the T-joint and copper used at the bottom of the frame, increasing the rigidity of the racket and further enhancing repulsion, enabling powerful drives to take your opponent by surprise. The wide profile of the frame is also key, providing extra racket surface stability to minimise warping during your swing and produce powerful, controlled shots.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO Frame:</strong> Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed.</p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC:</strong> Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>M40X:</strong> A next-generation, highly strong yet elastic carbon fiber.</p><p><strong>Sonic Flare System:</strong> The revolutionary new graphite material TORAYCAR M40X and SUPER HMG provide unrivaled power and stability for maximum shuttle acceleration.</p><p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber:</strong> The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft:</strong> The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS:</strong> A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>New Built In T-Joint:</strong> The lightweight T-Joint increases stability of the shuttle on the strings, maximizing power and control.</p><p> </p>",

    description:
      "<p>Introducing the next step for the Auraspeed 90k, the Victor Auraspeed 90K II, the weapon of choice for European Champion Anders Antonsen. Unlike most premium rackets, Victor has implemented their Whipping Enhancement System, allowing the 90K II frame to whip and flex on each shot, adding extra power and angles to your shoots whilst retaining high-end control. This makes the Auraspeed 90K II a  much more forgiving and user-friendly racket that can benefit a wider range of different playstyles. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>Hard Cored Technology </strong></p><p>Hard-cored technology provides players with optimal racket handling helping to increase their shot responsiveness. Inspired by helicopter rotor blade technology, a structure of multilayer carbon fibre and its composites, retains racket stiffness but minimises material size, reinforcing racket handling and performance.</p><p><strong>Pyrofil</strong></p><p>Pyrofil Carbon Fibre aids playable time till fatigue, in addition to better control and racket durability for all styles of play. Originating from the car industry, the Japanese Pyrofil ultra-light carbon fibre material and its composites enhance handling, control and shock absorption through high-intensity, ultra-light bonds. The additional benefit is a core strength, resulting in a reliable racket construction you can trust for years to come.</p><p><strong>Nano Fortify TR+</strong></p><p>Nano Fortify TR+ builds on Nano Fortify technology allowing players to generate accurate attacking power shots in responsive fast-paced rallies with the added benefits of improved racket durability, resilience and hand-feel. Built into the whole racket frame, Nano fortify TR+ provides advanced more durable carbon fibre, enabling it to generate bending strength and high repulsion power through the composition of tube-shaped carbon fibres. Therefore, retaining the accuracy of a stiff frame, optimised repulsion power and racket durability.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Sword</strong></p><p>Surprise your opponents with accurate swift sharp shots, as Dynamic sword technology raises your ability in attacking fast-paced styles of play. Dynamic Sword frames incorporate two distinct aerodynamic shapes that imitate a sword blade as it cuts through the air. The first shape, located at the top and bottom of the racket head (6/12 o’clock direction) features an inward-cutting frame, complimented by the secondary shape of an outward-cutting frame structure located on the left and right mid points of the racket head (3/9 o’clock direction). Therefore the Dynamic Sword shape leads to greater frame aerodynamics and reduced torsion (twisting), resulting in accurate swift attacks.</p><p><strong>Whipping Enhancement System (WES)</strong></p><p>The Whipping Enhancement System (WES) improves both the speed and steepness of your attacking shots (eg: smashes) without compromising control. This softer material, located in a specific part of the shaft stem near the throat enhances racket-head acceleration via a ‘whipping style’, creating faster, steeper attacks, with satisfying control.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

    description:
      "<p>The third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88S Pro is here, sporting a brand-new silver and black colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output, the 88S Pro is a trailblazing racket that stands out among the rest. </p><p>The 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) provides extra maneuverability, with the lower weight combining with the super slim shaft to minimise air resistance. The shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. </p><p>Numerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO+ Box Frame</strong>: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. </p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong>: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>Rotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force</strong>: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.</p><p><strong>Expanded Sweet Spot</strong>: The tailored 67cm racket length enables fast maneuverability, while the expansion of the sweet spot area by optimizing the frame design increases precision. Supports fast rallies and secures points from front-court attacks.</p><p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber</strong>: The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft</strong>: The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong>: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>Power Assister Bumper</strong>: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.</p><p><br></p>",

This racket was manufactured to enhance smashing power to dominate your opponents on the court, whilst its stability weight distribution technology keeps shots controlled and precise while boosting your power. The 3U weight (approx. 88 grams) of this racket makes it ideal for advanced players, with added vigor and accuracy provided by the extra weight. </p><p>Several technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court.

This makes the frame stronger and less flexible in this area allows the generation of more energy into the stroke. This normally indicates a little more weight in the top of the frame compared with normal frames, which also helps to optimise power.</p><p><strong>SLIM FRAME –</strong> The slim frame is 12-18% thinner than conventional rackets. This is achieved by combining superior high-grade materials and resins with proprietary production methods to achieve a slimmer racket frame that moves faster through the air, without sacrificing power or torsion.</p><p><br></p>",

    description:
      "<p>The third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88S Pro is here, sporting a brand-new silver and black colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output, the 88S Pro is a trailblazing racket that stands out among the rest. </p><p>The 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 3U weight (approx. 88 grams) along with head-heavy balance gives this racket some extra vigor for smashes, making this a force to be reckoned with on the court. The super slim shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. </p><p>Numerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. </p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>AERO+ Box Frame</strong>: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. </p><p><strong>ISOMETRIC</strong>: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.</p><p><strong>Rotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force</strong>: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.</p><p><strong>Expanded Sweet Spot</strong>: The tailored 67cm racket length enables fast maneuverability, while the expansion of the sweet spot area by optimizing the frame design increases precision. Supports fast rallies and secures points from front-court attacks.</p><p><strong>Ultra PE Fiber</strong>: The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.</p><p><strong>Super Slim Shaft</strong>: The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.</p><p><strong>Energy Boost CAP PLUS</strong>: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.</p><p><strong>Power Assister Bumper</strong>: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.</p><p><br></p>",
