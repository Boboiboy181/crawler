This makes the frame stronger and less flexible in this area allows the generation of more energy into the stroke. This normally indicates a little more weight in the top of the frame compared with normal frames, which also helps to optimise power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSLIM FRAME –\u003c/strong\u003e The slim frame is 12-18% thinner than conventional rackets. This is achieved by combining superior high-grade materials and resins with proprietary production methods to achieve a slimmer racket frame that moves faster through the air, without sacrificing power or torsion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

This makes the frame stronger and less flexible in this area allows the generation of more energy into the stroke. This normally indicates a little more weight in the top of the frame compared with normal frames, which also helps to optimise power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSLIM FRAME –\u003c/strong\u003e The slim frame is 12-18% thinner than conventional rackets.

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Yonex Arcsaber 7 Tour is the younger brother of the Arcsaber 7 Pro (used by some of the worlds best). The Tour version is designed to replicate the capabilities of the Pro but at an easier price point and tailored to suit the experienced club player.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Arcsaber 7 Tour is designed for the all-round player, looking to combine power, speed and control. The medium flex frame is forgiving and allows power generation on less explosive swings with a softer, whippier feel. This 4U/G5 version will likely suit experienced doubles players wanting a frame that will benefit them evenly in all parts of the court, in an all-round game style, with plenty of control.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eYonex have streamlined this latest edition, introducing a slimmer shaft for greater speed and a completely new frame design. The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact and continues on the forgiving comfortable feel that is synonymous with the Arcsaber range. Yonex have engineered this racket around the concept of 'hold for flight', meaning increased shuttle hold on the strings at impact, for greater control and feel.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eFeaturing:\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eISOMETRIC Enlarged Sweet Spot - The ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7% compared to a conventional round frame. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eSuper Slim Shaft - The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eEnergy Boost CAP Plus - Uniquely shaped cap which maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the sides arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting. This allows for greater control without losing the flex required for power generation.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eT-ANCHOR - A new composite material T-ANCHOR used in the T-joint helps reduce excess torque when hitting an off centre shot, making the racket more forgiving and easier to use.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eRexis Shaft - A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex moulding technique. Improves shot performance and dominates the game.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eBox Frame - The extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003ePOCKETING BOOSTER - The frame is lined with POCKETING BOOSTER, a proprietary rubber-like material emphasizing elasticity in the frame’s flex.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eEnhanced Arcsaber Frame - Control with confidence through this unique frame structure with varying levels of flex from top, sides, to bottom, built to increase shuttle hold while reducing instability and twisting at impact.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Yonex Arcsaber 7 Tour is the younger brother of the Arcsaber 7 Pro (used by some of the worlds best). The Tour version is designed to replicate the capabilities of the Pro but at an easier price point and tailored to suit the experienced club player.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe Arcsaber 7 Tour is designed for the all-round player, looking to combine power, speed and control. The medium flex frame is forgiving and allows power generation on less explosive swings with a softer, whippier feel. This 4U/G5 version will likely suit experienced doubles players wanting a frame that will benefit them evenly in all parts of the court, in an all-round game style, with plenty of control.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eYonex have streamlined this latest edition, introducing a slimmer shaft for greater speed and a completely new frame design. The built-in solid feel core cuts harmful miscellaneous vibration at impact and continues on the forgiving comfortable feel that is synonymous with the Arcsaber range. Yonex have engineered this racket around the concept of 'hold for flight', meaning increased shuttle hold on the strings at impact, for greater control and feel.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eFeaturing:\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eISOMETRIC Enlarged Sweet Spot - The ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7% compared to a conventional round frame. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eSuper Slim Shaft - The slimmest racquet ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eEnergy Boost CAP Plus - Uniquely shaped cap which maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the sides arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting. This allows for greater control without losing the flex required for power generation.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eT-ANCHOR - A new composite material T-ANCHOR used in the T-joint helps reduce excess torque when hitting an off centre shot, making the racket more forgiving and easier to use.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eRexis Shaft - A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex moulding technique. Improves shot performance and dominates the game.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eBox Frame - The extra stiff profile provides a solid stable feel on impact with the shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003ePOCKETING BOOSTER - The frame is lined with POCKETING BOOSTER, a proprietary rubber-like material emphasizing elasticity in the frame’s flex.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eEnhanced Arcsaber Frame - Control with confidence through this unique frame structure with varying levels of flex from top, sides, to bottom, built to increase shuttle hold while reducing instability and twisting at impact.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Yonex Astrox 88D Tour Racket is the little brother of the 88D Pro, slightly toned down to make it more user-friendly whilst still suitable for advanced players. Sporting a brand-new black and silver colourway and game-changing technology, the 88D Tour is an incredible racket for defensive players who enjoy playing from the back of the court. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 88D excels in backcourt play, being a robust and stable racket designed with power in mind. This racket was manufactured to enhance smashing power to dominate your opponents on the court, whilst its stability weight distribution technology keeps shots controlled and precise while boosting your power. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) of this racket makes it much more user-friendly and responsive, whilst still packing a powerful punch and being incredibly well-rounded. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court. For players who like splitting their opponent's defense open from the back of the court, this 88D Tour is a must-have. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+ Box Frame\u003c/strong\u003e: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force\u003c/strong\u003e: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStability Weight Distribution\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThe added weight distribution on the sides of the frame enhances stability during the swing, resulting in maximized smash power and allowing for the effective breakdown of defenses during back-court attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eREXIS Shaft\u003c/strong\u003e: A high-performance shaft precisely designed with an original Yonex molding technique.

When bending and releasing two racquets under the same force, the Ultra Slim Long Shaft rebounds almost twice as far as a conventional racquet does in the same length of time (0.018 seconds). This equates to 10% greater stability compared with conventional racquets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnergy Boost CAP PLUS\u003c/strong\u003e: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance.

For players looking to base their game on smashes and clears from the back of the court, the 88D is a perfect choice. Its 4U weight means it's also agile enough to perform close to the net, making this a super versatile racket, attractive to a large range of players. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%.

      "\u003cp\u003eThe third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88D Pro is here, sporting a brand-new black and silver colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at defensive players looking to maximise their control and power output, the 88D Pro is a state-of-the-art racket built for powerful players.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe 88D excels in backcourt play, being a robust and stable racket designed with power in mind. This racket was manufactured to enhance smashing power to dominate your opponents on the court, whilst its stability weight distribution technology keeps shots controlled and precise while boosting your power. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) of this racket makes it much more user-friendly and responsive, whilst still packing a powerful punch and being incredibly well-rounded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeveral technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court.

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Victor Auraspeed HS B badminton racket is an advanced level doubles racket for experienced players who are looking for greater speed and precision.\u003c/p\u003e   \u003cp\u003eThe Auraspeed HS (Hypersonic) has made the classic DYNAMIC-SWORD even lighter and thinner to lower the wind resistance and enable faster hits and returns. Engineered with the innovative new material Nano Fortify SR, the frame of ARS-HS is thin, light, stiff, durable, and fatigue-resistant. The speed and elasticity of the racket has been significantly improved, making ARS-HS a racket that can provide you with both outstanding stiffness and incredible handling experience.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eThe shaft is built with the cutting-edge composite carbon fiber material PYROFIL to make the racket stiff and lightweight. With a diameter of 6.8 mm, the shaft allows for more improvement in speed and enables smooth force transmission and greater controllability.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eUnlike traditional solid wooden handles, the FREE CORE synthetic handle made with nanotechnology has an innovative hollow structure to improve shock-absorption and create more space for the shaft to flex. It not only allows for smoother hitting and better rebound, but also makes the transition from defense to attack hard for the opponent to be prepared for. The transparent cap exclusively designed by VICTOR further provides a peek into the secret of FREE CORE technology.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eFeaturing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSEVEN SIX 76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePYROFIL - Pyrofil carbon fibre and it's composites, are advanced high performance materials from Japan. The characteristic of high intensity, ultra-light bonds offers excelent racket shock absorption and enhances control.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHARD CORED TECHNOLOGY - Inspired by military helicopters, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimises material sizes and reinforces handling performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFREE CORE - Designed by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionised handle style allows the shaft to move more freely. Swings are not only smoother but the overall feel and handling experience is improved.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCOMPOUND SWORD - The compound frame design can be divided into three major parts: The upper section is made with fan shaped structure to lower wind resistance and accelerate each swing. The Compund-Sword structure in the middle section is designed to lighten the filler and enable fast rebound. Finally, the lower section is built in airfoil structure to lower wind resistance and keep excellent anti-torsion performance in a 'whipping' style which helps to create steeper and quicker attacks with satisfying control.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNANO FORTIFY - The adoption of the single-wall carbon nanotube effectively enhances racket intensity, elasticity and fatigue resistance. The lightweight enhanced material enables both strength and smooth handling.\u003c/p\u003e",

Engineered with the innovative new material Nano Fortify SR, the frame of ARS-HS is thin, light, stiff, durable, and fatigue-resistant. The speed and elasticity of the racket has been significantly improved, making ARS-HS a racket that can provide you with both outstanding stiffness and incredible handling experience.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eThe shaft is built with the cutting-edge composite carbon fiber material PYROFIL to make the racket stiff and lightweight. With a diameter of 6.8 mm, the shaft allows for more improvement in speed and enables smooth force transmission and greater controllability.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eUnlike traditional solid wooden handles, the FREE CORE synthetic handle made with nanotechnology has an innovative hollow structure to improve shock-absorption and create more space for the shaft to flex. It not only allows for smoother hitting and better rebound, but also makes the transition from defense to attack hard for the opponent to be prepared for. The transparent cap exclusively designed by VICTOR further provides a peek into the secret of FREE CORE technology.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eFeaturing:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSEVEN SIX 76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePYROFIL - Pyrofil carbon fibre and it's composites, are advanced high performance materials from Japan. The characteristic of high intensity, ultra-light bonds offers excelent racket shock absorption and enhances control.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHARD CORED TECHNOLOGY - Inspired by military helicopters, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimises material sizes and reinforces handling performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFREE CORE - Designed by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionised handle style allows the shaft to move more freely. Swings are not only smoother but the overall feel and handling experience is improved.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCOMPOUND SWORD - The compound frame design can be divided into three major parts: The upper section is made with fan shaped structure to lower wind resistance and accelerate each swing. The Compund-Sword structure in the middle section is designed to lighten the filler and enable fast rebound. Finally, the lower section is built in airfoil structure to lower wind resistance and keep excellent anti-torsion performance in a 'whipping' style which helps to create steeper and quicker attacks with satisfying control.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNANO FORTIFY - The adoption of the single-wall carbon nanotube effectively enhances racket intensity, elasticity and fatigue resistance. The lightweight enhanced material enables both strength and smooth handling.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Victor Auraspeed Lightfighter 40 D Badminton Racket is a lightweight but head-heavy racket based on the Auraspeed series. If you're looking for a super fast and lightweight racket that still packs a punch from the rear of the court, then this may be the racket for you.\u003c/p\u003e  \u003cp\u003eThanks to the combination of Sword and Ultra Thin Frame technology, air resistance is reduced to a minimum. This racket is a collaboration between two popular Victor racket series; retaining the super lightweight-head heavy balance that has been synonymous with the Lightfighter range, but adding in the aerodynamic frame qualities of Auraspeed, to create even greater speed and manoeuvrability. Suitable for a fast and powerful game\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Victor Thruster Ryuga II 3U badminton racket is a lethal option for offensive players and is the weapon of choice for one of the most powerful and explosive players on the pro tour, Lee Zii Jia (Malaysia). The Ryuga II is suited to strong players looking to do most of their damage from the rear of the court with the medium-stiff flex and head heavy balance helping to transfer power into drives and smashes.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis 2nd generation Ryuga is a personal favourite of the BadmintonHQ staff, not only for its powerful characteristics, but also for the beautiful purple and black colourway.\u003c/p\u003e The Thruster Ryuga II features Victor's latest technology including the innovative Free Core handle for smoother swings, greater handling and improved comfort.  \u003cp\u003eFeaturing\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePower Box - The box shaped design effectively increases the stability and anti-torque, can stand stand higher string tension.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWES 2.0 - The innovative carbon fiber layering design has improved the anti-torsion performance, further making the racket flex faster with better force transmission. As a redefinition of 'whipping effect', the WES 2.0 allows the players to drive the shuttle at a sharp downward angle when attacking.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eSEVEN SIX 76 - The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePYROFIL - Pyrofil carbon fibre and it's composites, are advanced high performance materials from Japan. The characteristic of high intensity, ultra-light bonds offers excelent racket shock absorption and enhances control.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eHARD CORED TECHNOLOGY - Inspired by military helicopters, multi-layered structure made by carbon fiber and composites, minimises material sizes and reinforces handling performance.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFREE CORE - Designed by computer simulation and aided with the adoption of injection moulding technique, this revolutionised handle style allows the shaft to move more freely. Swings are not only smoother but the overall feel and handling experience is improved.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eNew for 2021, Yonex have raised the technological bar once more with the revolutionary Astrox 100 ZZ Kurenai.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFeaturing the SLIMMEST SHAFT EVER CREATED BY YONEX, the ZZ is able to slice through the air with reduced resistance. Most traditional rackets feature a hollow core within the racket shaft, however the Hyper Slim Shaft on the ZZ features a solid core graphite construction, providing extra resilience and greater power transfer.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe ever popular ISOMETRIC frame has also been tweaked to create an EXPANDED SWEET SPOT - 2.9% larger than previous models. With attention paid to every detail, Yonex has even redsigned the cap at the top of the handle to reduce shaft twisting and increase flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor those who like to place their thumb at the top of the grip whilst serving, the indent in the ENERGY BOOST CAP also provides a comfortable and stable place for the thumb to sit. By utilizing high quality Namd graphite throughout the shaft and frame, more flex is produced with a faster snapback, unleashing dramatic steep power. The material stays flexible even with increased swing speed, bending when swing speed increases and restoring its original hard shape at the end of the swing. The ability to bend even further and snap back rapidly, produces stronger shots and greater smash speeds.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe weapon of choice for former World and European Singles Champion, Viktor Axelson.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe Yonex Astrox 99 Pro Cherry Sunburst (3U) is a pure power racket and a complete re-design of the previous Astrox 99. The 3U weight is suited to singles or rear court doubles players with good physical strength. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDesigned in conjuction with World #1 and 2 x World Champion Kento Momota, the Astrox 99 Pro offers the heaviest swing weight of any in the ASTROX series for devastating rear court power. \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePOWER ASSIST BUMPER, a tungsten-infused nylon bumper, has been added to the top of the frame for increased swingweight and power.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e ROTATIONAL GENERATOR SYSTEM offers counterbalanced weight distribution, with weight optimised in key areas of the racket for max control and shot transition.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e NAMD, Yonex's revolutionary and premier graphite material is now present in both the shaft and the racket head.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e VOLUME CUT RESIN, an epoxy resin that has been used to construct the entire frame of the racket, is lighter in weight and has excellent strength, allowing it to support the new extra slim shaft.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eYonex have however, worked hard to ensure that all the extra headweight does not come at the expense of speed and have introduced an EXTRA SLIM SHAFT and fully recessed frame.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e Yonex have also refined the ISOMETRIC HEADSHAPE, for greater forgiveness and an optimised sweetspot. This is combined with a new stringing pattern, borrowed from the Astrox 88S, that looks to offer more control and longer shuttle hold.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlease note this racket does not include a racket cover. All Yonex rackets introduced into the market from 2021 are no longer supplied with covers for environmental purposes.\u003c/p\u003e",

This major improvement produces a shaft that flexes and stores energy, delivering explosive force on impact with the shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+BOX Frame\u003c/strong\u003e - Combines solid hitting feel and quick swing.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e - ISOMETRIC technology continues to help the world’s greatest players achieve global success. Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%*. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings. ISOMETRIC delivers greater control without sacrificing power.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System\u003c/strong\u003e - Counterbalanced Weight Distribution.

With a head-light balance, this racket can be whipped around with ease, so nothing can hold you back when defending smashing, or in flat rallies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis racket sports an extra cross string, increasing string density to boost surface pressure and create enhanced repulsion for accelerated drives. Combine this with the Sonic Flare system, which is strategically lined high-modulus graphite at the top and bottom of the frame, and you have a racket proven to produce high initial speeds upon hitting a shuttle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe frame itself is dedicated to drives, with a steep angle from the stringing area to the T-joint and copper used at the bottom of the frame, increasing the rigidity of the racket and further enhancing repulsion, enabling powerful drives to take your opponent by surprise. The wide profile of the frame is also key, providing extra racket surface stability to minimise warping during your swing and produce powerful, controlled shots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO Frame:\u003c/strong\u003e Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC:\u003c/strong\u003e Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%.

Unlike most premium rackets, Victor has implemented their Whipping Enhancement System, allowing the 90K II frame to whip and flex on each shot, adding extra power and angles to your shoots whilst retaining high-end control. This makes the Auraspeed 90K II a  much more forgiving and user-friendly racket that can benefit a wider range of different playstyles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHard Cored Technology \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHard-cored technology provides players with optimal racket handling helping to increase their shot responsiveness.

The Compound-Sword structure in the middle section is designed to lighten the filler and enable fast rebound. Finally, the lower section is built in an aerofoil structure to lower wind resistance and keep excellent anti-torsion performance in a “whipping” style which helps to create steeper and quicker attacks with satisfying control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRTC\u003c/strong\u003e – R.T.C. technology, based on scientifically-designed structure and data analysis, introduces a “reflection point” to the frame’s key spots to maximise the “rebound” performance, effectively improving both the quality and speed of each swing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSonic Rebounding Technology\u003c/strong\u003e – Integrates R.T.C. with highly resilient modulus graphite material to enable swift and all-around rebound performance, redefining what a SPEED racket could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSEVEN SIX76 \u003c/strong\u003e- The single-pass grommet hole construction creates less friction between strings, this effectively reduces tension loss, while extending string life.\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88S Pro is here, sporting a brand-new silver and black colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output, the 88S Pro is a trailblazing racket that stands out among the rest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 4U weight (approx. 83 grams) provides extra maneuverability, with the lower weight combining with the super slim shaft to minimise air resistance. The shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNumerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+ Box Frame\u003c/strong\u003e: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force\u003c/strong\u003e: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks.

The 3U weight (approx. 88 grams) of this racket makes it ideal for advanced players, with added vigor and accuracy provided by the extra weight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral technologies are featured in this racket, coming together to make it a true powerhouse on the court. For players who like splitting their opponent's defense open from the back of the court, few can compete with the 88D Pro. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+ Box Frame\u003c/strong\u003e: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force\u003c/strong\u003e: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStability Weight Distribution\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThe added weight distribution on the sides of the frame enhances stability during the swing, resulting in maximized smash power and allowing for the effective breakdown of defenses during back-court attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltra PE Fiber\u003c/strong\u003e: The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltra Slim Shaft\u003c/strong\u003e: Inserting NANOPREME into the racket shaft ensures greater stability compared to conventional rackets. When bending and releasing two racquets under the same force, the Ultra Slim Long Shaft rebounds almost twice as far as a conventional racquet does in the same length of time (0.018 seconds). This equates to 10% greater stability compared with conventional racquets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnergy Boost CAP PLUS\u003c/strong\u003e: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePower Assister Bumper\u003c/strong\u003e: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

This makes the frame stronger and less flexible in this area allows the generation of more energy into the stroke. This normally indicates a little more weight in the top of the frame compared with normal frames, which also helps to optimise power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSLIM FRAME –\u003c/strong\u003e The slim frame is 12-18% thinner than conventional rackets. This is achieved by combining superior high-grade materials and resins with proprietary production methods to achieve a slimmer racket frame that moves faster through the air, without sacrificing power or torsion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

      "\u003cp\u003eThe third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88S Pro is here, sporting a brand-new silver and black colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output, the 88S Pro is a trailblazing racket that stands out among the rest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 3U weight (approx. 88 grams) along with head-heavy balance gives this racket some extra vigor for smashes, making this a force to be reckoned with on the court. The super slim shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNumerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+ Box Frame\u003c/strong\u003e: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force\u003c/strong\u003e: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpanded Sweet Spot\u003c/strong\u003e: The tailored 67cm racket length enables fast maneuverability, while the expansion of the sweet spot area by optimizing the frame design increases precision.

      "\u003cp\u003eThe third generation of the Yonex Astrox 88S Pro is here, sporting a brand-new silver and black colourway and game-changing technology. Aimed at aggressive players looking to maximise their speed and power output, the 88S Pro is a trailblazing racket that stands out among the rest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 88S excels in doubles play, generating plenty of power from the back of the court, whilst also being perfect for keeping up with fast-paced rallies closer to the net. The 3U weight (approx. 88 grams) along with head-heavy balance gives this racket some extra vigor for smashes, making this a force to be reckoned with on the court. The super slim shaft has a stiff flex, ensuring all your shots are controlled, whilst the Isometric technology optimises the string crosses, enlarging your sweet spot, making this racket both forgiving and highly consistent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNumerous technologies combine to make this racket perform at a high level wherever you are on the court. Precise, powerful and quick, this racket is a must-have for serious enthusiasts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeatures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAERO+ Box Frame\u003c/strong\u003e: Smoother contours throughout the racquet head for less wind resistance and extra racquet speed, combined with the stability of a box frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eISOMETRIC\u003c/strong\u003e: Developed over 30 years ago, the ISOMETRIC design increases the sweet spot by 7%. Compared to a conventional round frame, a square-shaped ISOMETRIC racquet generates a larger sweet spot by optimizing the intersection of the main and cross strings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRotational Generator System + 2G-Namd Flex Force\u003c/strong\u003e: By applying the counterbalance theory, weight is carefully distributed throughout the grip end, frame top, and joint, enabling a smooth transition between powerful shots for rapid, successive attacks. The innovative graphite “2G-NamdTM Flex Force” used in the shaft, characterized by its quick flex and snapback, maximizes shot power and advances the performance of the Rotational Generator System.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExpanded Sweet Spot\u003c/strong\u003e: The tailored 67cm racket length enables fast maneuverability, while the expansion of the sweet spot area by optimizing the frame design increases precision. Supports fast rallies and secures points from front-court attacks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUltra PE Fiber\u003c/strong\u003e: The shaft is constructed using ‘Ultra PEF’ – ultra poly ethylene fiber – which is light enough to float on water yet able to withstand immense forces. these characteristics allow for maximum shock absorption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuper Slim Shaft\u003c/strong\u003e: The slimmest racket shaft ever produced by YONEX vastly reduces air resistance whilst providing maximum feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnergy Boost CAP PLUS\u003c/strong\u003e: A uniquely shaped cap that maximizes shaft performance. The front allows the shaft to flex, while the side arch-shaped curve stabilizes the racquet face by preventing the shaft from twisting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePower Assister Bumper\u003c/strong\u003e: Attached to enforce heavier, increased power by configuring the weight directed into the shuttlecock with a tungsten-infused nylon bumper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
